# Frontend Stack

We have decided to work with a framework that not only embraces all the capabilities of ReactJS as our main client-server bridge and is continuously maintained by their contributors but also tools that have been accepted widely by the community. We decided to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) & [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com).

# UI Mockups

From the very first hackathon, we worked on developing an idea into real content. Please check here the Mock-ups made so far to reproduce the Creative Platform visually.
