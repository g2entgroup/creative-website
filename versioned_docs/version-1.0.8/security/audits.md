# Audits & Testing

The Creative Protocol has undergone formal professional third party audits. And was [conducted by thirdweb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts).

Additionally, the Creative core team and affiliates has a long term security relationship with [ConsenSys Diligence](https://diligence.consensys.net/audits/), and [Cyfrin](https://cyfrin.io) including additional code reviews.

Notwithstanding, portions of the Creative Protocol codebase will continue to evolve, and **it should never be expected that 100% of the deployed code has been formally audited.**

We encourage responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities in the smart contracts and will pay up to $20,000 in CRTVO for those.  See the [Bounties](./bounties) for more details.
