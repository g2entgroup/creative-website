# Congratulations!

You have just discovered the **future of web3 careers** for creators and you're making some changes to the **old ways of earning**.

# Creators Onboarding

![Header Mockup](https://creativeplatform.xyz/img/mockups/latest/header.png)

1. Connect Wallet
    * We currently support Metamask, Venly, and Coinbase wallets.
    * Be sure you are connected to [Polygon RPC](https://medium.com/stakingbits/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network-838058f6d844).
2. Sign Up/Sign In

![SignIn Mockup](https://creativeplatform.xyz/img/mockups/latest/signIn.png)

As a creator you now have access to your very own media library of NFTs that you create from now on! You should now see an option to `Upload` and `My Library`

# Upload

![Upload Mockup](https://creativeplatform.xyz/img/mockups/latest/upload.png)

1. Fill out this form and upload media per instructions.
2. Click `Save`.
    * This saves all of the metadata in your library without minting it into an NFT. So you can `edit` and `delete` this data prior to minting permanently onchain.

# My Library

1. Go to `My Library` under Wallet address menu.
2. Click `Fetch Library` to load all of you assests within your library.
    * From this page you can either submit to a [Brand Campaign](./manage-docs-versions), edit, delete, or list your NFT for sale to various marketplaces (the choice is yours).

# Submit to Brand Campaign
You can submit to a brand campaign 2 ways.
1. `My Library`
2. Click a campaign from the homepage.
